Description: Provides tools for applying Sklar's Omega (Hughes, 2022) <doi:10.1007/s11222-022-10105-2>
    methodology to nominal scores, ordinal scores, percentages, counts, amounts (i.e.,
    non-negative real numbers), and balances (i.e., any real number). The framework can
    accommodate any number of units, any number of coders, and missingness; and
    can be used to measure agreement with a gold standard, intra-coder agreement,
    and/or inter-coder agreement. Frequentist inference is supported for all levels
    of measurement. Bayesian inference is supported for continuous scores only.
